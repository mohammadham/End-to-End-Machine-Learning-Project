# End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Project
Here I look at the exercises for this chapter. Note that these exercise are worked in notebooks presented by the book and thus one can get solutions there if desired. At the time of this writing the book’s solutions can be found https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/02_end_to_end_machine_learning_project.ipynb

Exercises
The following exercises are all based on this chapter’s housing dataset:
1. Try a Support Vector Machine regressor (sklearn.svm.SVR) with
various hyperparameters, such as kernel="linear" (with various
values for the C hyperparameter) or kernel="rbf" (with various
values for the C and gamma hyperparameters). Don’t worry about what
these hyperparameters mean for now. How does the best SVR
predictor perform?
2. Try replacing GridSearchCV with RandomizedSearchCV.
3. Try adding a transformer in the preparation pipeline to select only the
most important attributes.
4. Try creating a single pipeline that does the full data preparation plus
the final prediction.
5. Automatically explore some preparation options using
GridSearchCV.
if have better answer help me to improve this codes.
